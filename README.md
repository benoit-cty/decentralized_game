# Decentralized space game

A game for mid-term exam of https://www.theschool.ai/ by Siraj Raval.

Play it on http://unbouncepages.com/exoloop/

## Rules of the game

Every gamers start from Earth and need to buy SpaceShip to explore other system.
Or buy a Planet who has already been discovered.
Ppl who own an entire system get improvement. For example could build SpaceShip for others.
Spaceship disapeer if you want to colonize a planet. So if you discover one you could sell it as is or colonize it to sell his ressources.
Once you own a planet you could buy improvement from others planets.
Spaceship could buy ressources from Planet and sell them to other planets.
Every item could be sold to others player.

## Technical architecture

Planets and Spaceship are ERC721 tokens so it could be bougth and sold with ETH.

We use Truffle as a the main framework. Ganache-cli as test blockchain.

### Generating planets and spaceship

To create the planets and spaceship we do :
- Scrapping of http://www.scifiideas.com/spaceship-name-generator/ and store it in a JSON
- Iterate the JSON and loading it into our contracts with "truffle exec tools/load_planet_to_contract.js"
- Scrapping of Google image using googleimagesdownload -k "spaceship colonization" (https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download )
- Resize and crop of the picture to 256x256 using ImageMagick in a Python script tools/resize_and_crop.py
- We upload them to IPFS using NodeJS
- Finally we feed these datas in the contracts with NodeJS

### Dependencies

```
"dependencies": {
  "cheerio": "^1.0.0-rc.2",    => For scrapping
  "lite-server": "^2.3.0",     => For easy testing of the front
  "request": "^2.85.0",        => For scrapping
  "request-promise": "^4.2.2", => For scrapping
  "zeppelin-solidity": "1.8.0" => For smart contract models, but we don't use it finally.
}
```

## Creation step

```
sudo npm install -g ganache-cli truffle
mkdir decentralized_game
cd decentralized_game/
truffle init
npm init -y
npm install -E zeppelin-solidity
```

## Run the project

run ganache-cli
```
git clone https://github.com/trancept/decentralized_game.git
cd decentralized_game
npm install
truffle compile
truffle migrate
truffle test
truffle exec tools/load_planet_to_contract.js
truffle exec tools/load_spaceship_to_contract.js
npm run dev
```
